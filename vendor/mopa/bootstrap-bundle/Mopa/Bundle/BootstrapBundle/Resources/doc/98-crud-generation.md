CRUD Generation
---------------

The Bundle provides a new console command:
```bash
./app/console mopa:generate:crud

It extends the base doctrine CRUD generator and modifies the theme to support the bootstrap layout.

This feature is more ore less experimental. There are several PR's about this, also in the SensioGeneratorBundle, because it ties this Bundle to others.

I hope we can have this in a adavanced version, but it could also be removed.
